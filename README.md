# Osman Ordu - Software Developer

I design and build production-grade, high-performance web applications with a strong focus on real-time data, scalability, and system reliability.

My work centers on latency-sensitive, data-intensive systems where UI stability, performance, and correctness are non-negotiable.
I specialize in Fintech, Crypto, and high-traffic platforms operating under real-world load.

I don’t just ship features —
I engineer systems that stay fast, predictable, and resilient in production.
